# nitro

Virtual Machine Introspection for KVM.

This is the userland component named `nitro`.
It will receive the events generated by KVM and display them.

# Requirements

- `cmake`
- `python 3`
- `docopt`
- `libvirt`

# Setup

You have to compile `libnitro` :

    cd libnitro
    mkdir _build
    cd _build
    cmake ..
    make

This should produce `libnitro/libnitro.so`.

# Usage

- Make sure that you have loaded the modified kvm modules.

- Start the VM that you would like to monitor.
(Nitro only supports for now `Windows XP x64` and `Windows 7 x64`.)

- Wait for the desktop to be available on the VM.

- Start nitro : `./nitro.py $(pgrep qemu)`

You should see the `syscall` and `sysret` being captured and displayed.
